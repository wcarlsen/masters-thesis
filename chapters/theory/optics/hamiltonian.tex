So far we have only described the optomechanical system classically and seen that it is absolutely possible to  among other things show cooling effects. It is now time to write out a full blown quantum mechanical model for our optomechanical system. We will start by writing out the Hamiltonian of a generic optomechanical system \cite{law1995}

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{mech} + \hat{H}_{opt} + \hat{H}_{int} + \hat{H}_{drive}.
\end{equation}
\noindent
The full Hamiltonian consist of an optical drive $\hat{H}_{drive}$, an optical harmonic oscillator part for the cavity field $\hat{H}_{opt}$, a purely mechanical harmonic oscillator part $\hat{H}_{mech}$ (as equation \eqref{eq:ham_mech}) and most importantly the interaction part between mechanics and light $\hat{H}_{int}$. We write out the individual Hamiltonians

\begin{align}
\hat{H}_{mech} & = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m_{eff}} + \frac{1}{2}m_{eff}\Omega_m^2\hat{x}^2 \\
\hat{H}_{opt} & = \hbar\omega_c\left( \hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\right) \\
\hat{H}_{int} & = \hbar G\hat{x}\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} \\
\hat{H}_{drive} & = i\hbar\sqrt{\eta_c\kappa}(s_{in}(t)\hat{a}^\dagger - s_{in}^*(t)\hat{a}),
\end{align}
\noindent
where $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ are the position and momentum operators of the mechanical oscillator as in equation \eqref{eq:qm_pos} and \eqref{eq:qm_mom}, $m_{eff}$ is the effective mass and $\Omega_m$ is the angular mechanical resonance frequency. The operators $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity mode and $\omega_c$ is the cavity resonance in angular frequency. $G$ is the optical frequency shift per displacement and $\eta_c = \frac{\kappa_{ex}}{\kappa_0 + \kappa_{ex}}$ is the coupling parameter for the cavity, where $\kappa_0$ is the intrinsic loss rate and $\kappa_{ex}$ is the external loss rate associated with the incoupling mirror, and $s_{in}(t)$ is the classical input drive field amplitude normalized to photon flux, previously we used $E_{in}(t)$ for this, but for easy comparison with the currently used notation in this group $s_{in}$ is used. The radiation pressure force is then 

\begin{equation}
\hat{F}_{rad} = -\frac{d\hat{H}_{int}}{d\hat{x}} = -\hbar G\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}.
\end{equation}
